Pipeline to call DRIP peaks with stochhmm

1. ./normalize.pl input.wig normalized.wig
2. ./wig2fa.pl -i normalized.wig -o normalized.customfa
3. stochhmm -seq normalized.customfa -model DRIP.hmm -posterior -threshold 0.9 -gff > peaks.txt

StochHMM source: https://github.com/KorfLab/StochHMM

Warnings:

- wig must be variableStep format. 
- normalize.pl assumes span to be constant. 
- modifying DRIP.hmm or the convert() subroutine of wig2fa.pl will result in negatively affected peak calling!

Normalization:

Process implemented in normalize.pl:
- Linear median shift
  - Round all values
  - Throw away all values less than the third quartile.
  - Find median of the remaining values.
  - Divide DRIP median (10) that the model was trained on by the median of the input data to find the multiplication factor. 
  - Multiply every value in the wig file by the factor.
